# CS179J-Group7

This is for course CS179J-- Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems.

We are proposing a robot-car project based on NVIDIA Jetson Nano, which is a powerful computer that lets us run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing.

Now we have some functions to implement:

- Line detection 
- object tracking
- obstacle avoidance
- Moving to the specific coordinate
- SLAM
