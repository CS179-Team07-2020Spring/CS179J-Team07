# CS179J-Group7

This is for course CS179J-- Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems.

We are proposing a robot-car project based on NVIDIA Jetson Nano, which is a powerful computer that lets us run multiple neural networks in parallel for applications like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and speech processing.

Features that will be implemented:

- [x] Basic Motions

- [ ] Object tracking/following

- [ ] Obstacle avoidance
- [ ] Obstacle avoidance(deep reinforcement learning)
- [ ] Moving to a specific location
- [ ] Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
